###Introduction:
In this project, we will develop a machine learning model to predict the success of a base steal in Major League Baseball (MLB) using player statistics, advanced statistics, and performance data. The goal of this project is to create a tool that can be used by MLB teams to improve their base stealing strategy and player performance. We will also develop a website that will display the data visually and will be used to present the results and the model to the team and provide recommendations on how to use it.

###Background:
Predicting the success of a base steal in MLB is a challenging task due to the many factors that can influence a runner's ability to steal a base. These include the runner's speed, lead off distance, and jump; the pitcher's delivery time; and the catcher's pop time and arm strength. In addition, MLB teams use advanced statistics such as Baserunning Runs (BsR) to evaluate their players' base stealing abilities.

###Methods:
- The data for this project will consist of statistics and other relevant information about MLB runners, pitchers, and catchers. This data will be sourced from baseball statistics databases and individual team websites.
- The first step of the project will be to collect and organize the relevant data. This will involve identifying the most important features for predicting base stealing success and sourcing the appropriate data.
- Next, we will split the data into training and test sets and use appropriate machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks to train and evaluate the model.
- We will use various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score to assess the model's performance.
- Once the model is trained, we will use it to identify the most important factors in determining the success or failure of a stolen base attempt and identify areas for improvement in a runner's base stealing abilities.
- After that, we will develop a website to display the data visually and present the results and the model to the team and provide recommendations on how to use it.

###Task Breakdown:
Data collection and organization
Data cleaning and preprocessing 
Model training and evaluation
Web development and data visualization 
Analysis and results presentation 

###Expected Timeline:
Data collection and organization: 2 weeks
Data cleaning and preprocessing: 1 week
Model training and evaluation: 3 weeks
Web development and data visualization: 2 weeks
Analysis and results presentation: 1 week

###Deliverables:
Clean and organized data set
Trained machine learning model
Website displaying data visualizations
Report on model performance and important factors in determining base stealing success
Presentation of results and recommendations to the team

###Notes:
Data collection and organization will be the most time-consuming part of the project, so it is important to allocate enough resources to this task
Regular meetings should be scheduled to track progress and address any issues that arise
Each team member should be responsible for documenting their work and updating the team on their progress
Communication is key, so all team members should have clear and open lines of communication throughout the project
In this way, each team member is aware of their role, the timeline, and the deliverable, and the team will have a visual tool to present the results, the website will also be a helpful tool for the team to consult and evaluate the results, giving them the ability to make better and well-informed decisions based on the model predictions.
