# Predicting Base Stealing Success in Major League Baseball using Machine Learning

1. The selected topic for the project is the development of a machine learning model to predict whether an MLB runner will be able to successfully steal 2nd or 3rd base based on their running speed, the pitcher's average pitch speed, and the catcher's pop time. The reasoning for this selection may be that such a model could be useful for coaching and strategy decisions in baseball games, as well as for analyzing player performance and identifying potential areas for improvement.

2. The data for this project would likely consist of statistics and other relevant information about MLB runners, pitchers, and catchers. This may include running speed measurements for the runners, pitch speed measurements for the pitchers, and pop time measurements for the catchers. Other relevant data may include the results of previous stolen base attempts (successful or unsuccessful), the number of innings played, the position played, and any other factors that may influence a runner's ability to steal a base.

3. The questions that the team originally planned to answer with the project may include:

- Can a machine learning model accurately predict whether an MLB runner will be able to successfully steal a base based on their running speed, the pitcher's average pitch speed, and the catcher's pop time?
- What factors are most important in determining the success or failure of a stolen base attempt?
- Can the model be used to identify areas for improvement in a runner's base stealing abilities?

4. During the data exploration phase of the project, the team would likely start by collecting and organizing the relevant data. This may involve sourcing data from a variety of sources, such as baseball statistics databases or individual team websites. The team would then likely analyze the data to get a better understanding of its characteristics and any patterns or trends that may be present. This may involve generating summary statistics, creating visualizations, and identifying any missing or incomplete data.

5. In the analysis phase of the project, the team would use the collected data to train and evaluate a machine learning model to predict whether an MLB runner will be able to successfully steal a base. This may involve splitting the data into training and test sets, selecting and tuning an appropriate model and algorithms, and using various evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance. The team may also explore different feature engineering techniques to identify the most important features for predicting base stealing success.

6. The technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms that the team may use throughout the project may include:

Languages: Python, R
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, R Studio
Machine learning libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
Machine learning algorithms: decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks.
