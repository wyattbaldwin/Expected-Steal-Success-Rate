# Predicting Base Stealing Success in Major League Baseball using Machine Learning

This project is a comprehensive course on data analytics that covers a wide range of topics and tools, including Excel, Python, SQL, and web development. The course also delves into advanced topics such as Tableau and machine learning. Through this course, I have gained a strong understanding of data visualization, data ethics, and ETL processes.

The highlight of the course was the final project where I led a group of participants to create a new advanced statistic in baseball called the expected steal success rate. This new statistic utilizes data visualization and machine learning techniques.

I have honed my skills in Excel, Python, SQL and web development, and have gained a strong understanding of advanced topics such as Tableau and machine learning. I have also gained experience in data visualization, data ethics and ETL process.

The final project was a great opportunity to apply my newfound knowledge and skills in the field of data analytics. I am confident that my comprehensive understanding of data analytics tools and technologies, and my ability to think creatively and work collaboratively, will make me a valuable asset to any organization.

## Factors that can affect a player's ability to steal a base:
### Runner-
Speed: A runner's speed plays a crucial role in his ability to steal a base. A faster runner will have an easier time stealing a base than a slower runner.

Lead off distance: The distance the runner starts from his base before the pitcher throws the ball, the bigger the lead off, the better the chance to reach next base.

Jump: A runner's ability to get a quick start and "jump" off the base can also play a role in a successful steal.
### Pitcher-
Delivery time: The pitcher's delivery time to home plate can affect the ability of the runner to steal a base. Faster deliveries makes it more difficult for the runner to get a good jump.
### Catcher-
Pop time: The time it takes for the catcher to release the ball after receiving it from the pitcher can play a role in a successful steal.

Arm strength: A catcher with a strong arm will make it more difficult for the runner to reach the next base.

## Current Advanced Stat MLB Teams Use:
Baserunning Runs (BsR) is a statistic that estimates the number of runs a player contributes or subtracts to his team through their baserunning skills. BsR takes into account various factors, such as stolen base attempts, taking extra bases on hits, and advancing on fly balls. A positive BsR value indicates that a player is adding value to his team through their baserunning skills, while a negative BsR value indicates that a player is subtracting value from his team through their baserunning skills.

BsR is similar to the statistic "+/-" in hockey which measures the impact of a player on the number of goals scored by the team while they were on the ice. Both +/- and BsR attempt to capture the overall value of a player's skills within the context of the team and should not be the only measure of a player's performance.

BsR can be a useful tool in determining the runner's jump, but it does not take into account the situation.

## Fixed Data:
- The distance between home plate and the pitching rubber on a Major League Baseball field is 60 feet, 6 inches (18.44 meters).
- The distance between the bases on a Major League Baseball field is 90 feet (27.432 meters).
- The distance from home plate to second base in Major League Baseball is about 127 feet and 3 inches (38.71 meters).

## Data:
BsR can be used in conjunction with other statistics such as batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage to provide a more complete picture of a player's performance. Additionally, it can be used in combination with defensive metrics such as fielding percentage and range factor to evaluate a player's overall value on the field.

It's also worth noting that BsR is a statistic that is most commonly used in baseball, but similar metrics exist in other sports such as hockey and basketball. In hockey, the statistic "+/-" attempts to measure a player's impact on the number of goals scored by the team while they were on the ice. In basketball, the statistic plus-minus attempts to measure a player's impact on the number of points scored by the team while they were on the court.

In terms of fixed data, it's important to note that the dimensions of a baseball field can vary depending on the level of play. While the dimensions of a Major League Baseball field are standardized, fields in lower levels of play may have different measurements. Additionally, while the distance between the bases and home plate is fixed, other elements of the field such as the height of the pitcher's mound, the size of the strike zone, and the type of surface the field is played on can also impact the game.
